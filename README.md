Hello, 
Currently developing a new War of Rights resource tool using fancy frameworks and api's for overkill planning, collaboration and community fun.
It is still a work in development but I feel is far along enough to share.

## Public User Features

### __Map Resource Tool Features__
- In-Depth Map Filtering Categories (Search, Campaign, Artillery, Favorites, Attacker)
- Saves live filter states and restores when you return to the map list after a route change or session exit.
- Each Map has Map Images w/ marked artillery positions, fly over cameras, as well as infantry & artillery information.
- Ability to share map details page to clipboard.

### __Additional Resources__
- In-Game Weapons with range, ammo, etc.
- War of Rights Steam API data such as patch notes, updates, screenshots, latest price, etc.

## Registered User Features:

### __Maps__
- Favorite Maps (Use as search filter).
- Map notes, each map will have its own notepad for user notes.
- StratSketch (Requires you to be logged into a basic StratSketch account).

### __User Settings__
- Change Password
- Change Avatar Url
- Manage Map Favorites
- Sync Discord Account (Under Development) This will allow users to join registered regiments and integrate/link them with their regiments discord/app data. 
- Join Regiment (Under Development)

## Regiment Dashboard (Elevated Permissions)

### __Regiment Tools__
- Event Share Tool - Gather all details for an event (servername, password, skirmish area, maps, sides, regiment, etc.) and post them
  in a chosen discord event channel set in the settings section of the regiment dashboard.
- Data is currently synced a Discord Bot you have to invite to your discord for it can grab guild data such as channel names, roles, 
  guild avatar, etc.
- Ability to register a new regiment via an admin bot command and set that user as regiment owner, that user will then be able to add 
  more regiment admins.

### Coming Soon
- Regiment & User Profiles - this should end up being pretty cool with discord integration being able to extract a user's discord roles such
  as medals and accolades and display them on the profiles.
